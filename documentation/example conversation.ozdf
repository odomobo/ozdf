==== Joe
What a wonderful day we're having, don't you think?

==== Beth
I've always had a special place in my heart for fall. The leaves changing, the smell of the turning season, of bonfires. The feeling of wearing a warm, cozy sweater in the cool night air. I even feel comforted by the overcast skies.

==== Joe
I meant less of that, and I was thinking it's been nice getting a chance to walk together with you.

==== Beth
Oh! Yes, I suppose so, although I do go on walks quite often. It's almost a part of my routine now.

==== Joe
Blah blah. Oh, hi Fred, nice to see you here!

==== Fred
Hi Joe! Who's your girlfriend?

==== Beth
Oh! It's not like that, we're just friends! I'm Beth! Blah blah blah.

==== Fred
Blah blah blah. Haha!

==== Joe
Haha! Blah blah...
